<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1" data-line-end="2">Cosm, prefix meaning of universe, or world, is the best word to be here. <strong>Here is my micro-cosm, thanks for visiting!</strong> So let me just simply guide you through my wonderful cosm. In past, I created a basic structure of the cosm, what should I do next with this cosm? First, I created a civilization, then I published it, it’s stored in the <strong>‘/blog’</strong>. But in some cases, the civiliaztion won’t get to publish, I then put it in the <strong>‘\hidden-blog’</strong>. When I give a mission to those civilization, the mission will be counted as a project, so let’s just record and save it in the <strong>‘\proj’</strong>. I also won’t forgot civilization’s accomplishments, their final work were stored in <strong>‘\file’</strong> and maybe also the place I created this cosm.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="13" data-line-end="14">I choose the homework from a personal website, the auther is “the endless v”, The most top article he post in his personal website is called “About the Website - Cosm”. This artical is intresting because the auther used cosm, a rare word, to describe the personal world he made. The the main idea of this story is that the auther use cosmoic civilization to replace things he post on his personal website, which is a very fun way of writing the his own website. Every mission that the civilization do is a project, everything done is a file. This is intresting way of describing his website.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="15" data-line-end="17"><strong>Score:</strong> 88/100<br>
<em>Nathan, this is a good analyze! But try to avoid more grammar mistake, I hope you can improve more next time!</em></p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="21" data-line-end="24">This about page provides a brief overview of the website owner’s personal cosm, which is a term used to describe a universe or world. The page mentions that the cosm includes a civilization and projects, which are stored in various directories on the website.<br>
The website owner appears to be interested in creating and developing his own world and documenting its progress. The fact that there is a separate directory for hidden blog posts suggests that the owner may have some content that is not meant to be publicly available.<br>
Overall, the tone of the page is informative and straightforward, without any attempt to market or promote the cosm or the website itself. Instead, it seems designed to provide visitors with a basic understanding of what they can expect to find on the site.</p>
