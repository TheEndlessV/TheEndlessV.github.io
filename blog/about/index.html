<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1" data-line-end="2">Cosm, prefix meaning of universe, or world, is the best word to be here. Here is my micro-cosm, thanks for visiting! So let me just simply guide you through my wonderful cosm. In past, I created this cosm, what should I do with this Cosm? First, I created a civilization, then I published it, it’s stored in the ‘/blog’. But in some cases, the civiliaztion won’t get to publish, I then put it in the ‘\hidden-blog’. When I give a mission to those civilization, the mission will be counted as a project, so let’s just record and save it in the ‘\proj’. I also won’t forgot civilization’s accomplishments, their final work were stored in ‘\file’ and maybe also the place I created this cosm.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="13" data-line-end="14">I choose the online essay from a personal website, the auther is “the endless v”, “About the Website - Cosm” is a intresting article because the auther used cosm a rare word, to describe the world. The the main idea of this story is that the auther use civilization to replace every blog or article he post on his personal website, which is a very fun way of writing the about page of the website. every mission that the civilization do is a project, the auther could say that he post the project directly, but he make everything vivid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="15" data-line-end="17"><strong>Score:</strong> 88/100<br>
<em>Nathan, this is a good analyze! But try to avoid more grammar mistake, I hope you can improve more next time!</em></p>
